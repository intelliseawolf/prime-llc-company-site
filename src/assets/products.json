This benefits farmers with higher APYs, not requiring active management, and lower gas fees.<br /><br />We also integrated leveraged yield farming & lending pools into the platform, providing an investment with suitable risk rewards for any DeFi user.<br /><br /></p><div class=\"data\"><h5>What options does Tulip offer, and which is right for me?</h5></div><p>Tulip Protocol currently offers three types of yield products, ‚ÄúVaults‚Äù, ‚ÄúLending‚Äù & ‚ÄúLeveraged Farming‚Äù.
